In this article, we will show you how to make a slot machine using PVC pipe and duct tape.</p>
<p>First, you will need to gather the following supplies:</p>
<p>-PVC pipe (3” diameter)<br>-Duct tape<br>-Ruler or measuring tape<br>-Marker<br>-Zip ties<br>-Penny<br>-Scissors</p>
<p>Start by cutting the PVC pipe into two equal lengths (2 feet each). Then, use a marker to draw three lines on one of the pieces of pipe, evenly spaced apart. The lines should be about 1/2 inch apart. Next, use scissors to cut along the lines. This will create three separate slots in the pipe.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to assembly the slot machine. Start by zip tying the penny to one end of the other piece of PVC pipe. Then, thread the pipe through the first slot on the other piece of pipe. Finally, secure the other end of the pipe to the other side of the penny with another zip tie.</p>
<p>Your slot machine is now complete! To use it, simply drop a coin into the top of the machine and pull back on the lever. The coin will travel through each of the three slots and will eventually fall out of the bottom slot.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Make-a-Slot-Machine-for-Under-10"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Slot-Machine-for-Under-10" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Slot Machine for Under $10"></a>How to Make a Slot Machine for Under $10</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Making a slot machine is a fun and easy project that can be completed for under $10. This guide will show you how to make your own slot machine using cardboard, a coin, and some basic tools.</p>
<h2 id="Materials"><a href="#Materials" class="headerlink" title="Materials"></a>Materials</h2><p>To make your own slot machine, you will need the following materials:</p>
<p>-Cardboard or other sturdy material for the body of the machine<br>-A coin for use as the spinner<br>-Hot glue gun and glue sticks<br>-Scissors<br>-Ruler or measuring tape<br>-Pilot pen or other sharp object for making marks on the cardboard<br>-Xacto knife or other sharp blade for cutting out the slots in the cardboard<br>-Optional: Paint or other decorations to dress up your machine</p>
<h2 id="Step-One-Create-the-Body-of-the-Slot-Machine"><a href="#Step-One-Create-the-Body-of-the-Slot-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Step One: Create the Body of the Slot Machine"></a>Step One: Create the Body of the Slot Machine</h2><p>Begin by measuring and cutting out a piece of cardboard into the shape of a rectangle. The dimensions of your rectangle should be such that it is slightly larger than your coin in both height and width. Once you have cut out the body of your slot machine, use a ruler or measuring tape to draw evenly spaced lines across its width, dividing it into five equal sections. Then use a sharp object (like a pilot pen) to make dots on each line at evenly spaced intervals. These dots will serve as guides for cutting out slots in the cardboard later on.</p>
<pre><code> Finally, use an Xacto knife or other sharp blade to cut along the dotted lines, creating five evenly spaced slots in your cardboard rectangle. Be careful not to cut yourself! If you’d like, you can also paint or decorate your slot machine at this point. I recommend adding some shiny gold accents to really give it that casino feel.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Next, take your hot glue gun and put a small amount of glue on one end of your coin. Then press it firmly against the center of the top side of your cardboard rectangle (the side without any slots). Hold it in place until the glue dries completely. This will serve as the spinner for your machine.3) Now it’s time to attach the sides of your machine. Glue one side vertically flush against the left edge of your rectangle, then do the same with the right side. Make sure that both sides are straight and even before gluing them in place.4) Finally, glue one end of each remaining side flush against the corresponding end of the front and back pieces, thus completing the rectangular frame of your slot machine. Allow all glued areas to dry completely before moving on to Step Two . typewriter font&gt; ## Step Two: Making The Coin SlotNow it’s time to create the actual coin slot that players will use to insert their coins into our machine.1) Using a ruler or measuring tape, find the center point of both short ends of your cardboard rectangle and draw a horizontal line connecting these points. This line will serve as our guide for creating our coin slot later on.2) Next, use scissors to carefully cut out a small rectangular opening along each drawn line (be sure not to cut beyond them). These openings will form our coin slot once we fold up our machine later on . typewriter font&gt;3) You should now have two small rectangular openings forming what looks like an upside down ‘T’ shape when viewed from above . Typewriter font&gt;4) Finally , use a hot glue gun to attach one end flap of each opening securely against its respective long edge (see photo below). Make sure that both flaps are glued down tightly before moving on . typewriter font&gt;Now Your Slot Machine Is Almost Finished! All that’s left is to fold up our sides so that our coin slot is properly aligned .5) To do this, begin by folding up each bottom edge so that it meets exactly in line with our horizontal guide line drawn in Step One . typewriter font&gt;6) Next , fold up each side so that it covers and conceals our newly created bottom edge (see photo below). Be sure that all edges are neatly lined up and even before gluing them in place . typewriter font&gt;7) Finally , use hot glue gun to attach both top flaps securely against their respective long edges , thus completing our folded up coin slot (see photo below). Again , allow all glued areas plenty of time to dry before moving on . typewriter font&gt;Your Slot Machine Is Now Complete! Congrats On A Job Well Done!</li>

<h1 id="How-to-Make-a-Slot-Machine-Out-of-Paper"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Slot-Machine-Out-of-Paper" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Slot Machine Out of Paper"></a>How to Make a Slot Machine Out of Paper</h1><p>A slot machine is a casino gambling machine with three or more reels which spin when a button is pushed. Slot machines are also known as one-armed bandits because they were originally operated by one lever on the side of the machine.</p>
<p>You can make your own slot machine out of paper using this easy tutorial. You will need some basic supplies including cardboard, scissors, a glue stick, markers, and a stapler.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Begin by cutting a piece of cardboard into two equal squares.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Draw three vertical lines on one of the squares using a marker. These lines will represent the slots on the slot machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cut along the lines you drew in step 2 using scissors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Glue the two squares together so that the lines you cut in step 3 create slots on the outside of the machine. Be sure to use a strong glue stick so that the cardboard stays together well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use markers to draw symbols or numbers on each of the nine squares in the lower row of the machine. These symbols will be used to determine your payout when you win!</p>
</li>
<li><p>staple each corner of the upper square to each corner of the lower square so that your slot machine is nice and sturdy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now it’s time to play! Insert a coin into the slot on top and then push down on the lever to spin the reels. If you match three symbols in a row, you’ll win!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Make-a-Slot-Machine-with-a-Pringles-Can"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Slot-Machine-with-a-Pringles-Can" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Slot Machine with a Pringles Can"></a>How to Make a Slot Machine with a Pringles Can</h1><p>This article will show you how to make a slot machine using a Pringles can.</p>
<p>You will need the following supplies:</p>
<p>-Pringles can<br>-Two paper clips<br>-Coin (quarter or smaller)<br>-Scissors<br>-Tape<br>-Marker</p>
<ol>
<li>Cut the top off of the Pringles can using scissors. Make sure to cut straight across so that the can is in two pieces. The top should now be able to be opened and closed like a book.</li>
<li>Tape the two paper clips onto the inside of the Pringles can, at either end of the “book” like so:</li>
</ol>
<p> 3. Put a coin into the can, between the two paper clips. Now fold the top of the Pringles can back down so that the coin is held between the paper clips and the top of the can.<br>4. Use a marker to make two small dots on either side of where the coin sits (see photo). This is where you will need to poke holes later on.<br>5. Carefully open up the top of the Pringles can again, making sure not to lose your coin! 6. Poke holes in each of the dots you made earlier using a sharp object like a needle or knife. Make sure both holes are big enough for a paper clip to fit through easily. 7. Tape up the top of your Pringles can again, making sure that all holes are covered up securely. 8 . You’re done! To play, just open up the top of your Pringles can and hold it upright like a real slot machine. Pull down on each side of the “book” until either side of the coin pops out (depending on if you’re playing quarter or penny slots!)</p>
