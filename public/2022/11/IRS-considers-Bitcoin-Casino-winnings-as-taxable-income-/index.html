<p>The ruling comes as no surprise to many in the Bitcoin community, who have long speculated that Bitcoin casinos would be treated in the same way as traditional ones. The announcement makes it clear that any profits made from gambling with Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will be subject to income tax.</p>
<p>This is a major development for the cryptocurrency world, and could lead to a number of Bitcoin-based businesses rethinking their operations. While it is unlikely that many people will stop using Bitcoin altogether, the news may dampen enthusiasm for using the currency in gambling-related activities.</p>
<p>For now, it remains to be seen how this new ruling will be received by the wider public. Many people may see it as another sign that digital currencies are here to stay, while others may see it as yet another obstacle to overcome.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-avoid-taxes-on-Bitcoin-Casino-winnings"><a href="#How-to-avoid-taxes-on-Bitcoin-Casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="How to avoid taxes on Bitcoin Casino winnings"></a>How to avoid taxes on Bitcoin Casino winnings</h1><p>Casinos have been around for centuries, and while the games have changed over time, one thing has remained the same: At some point, you’re going to have to pay taxes on your winnings. </p>
<p>This is especially true for Bitcoin casinos. While there are some tax-free Bitcoin gambling destinations available, the vast majority of sites will require you to report your winnings come tax time. </p>
<p>But don’t worry - following a few simple tips can help minimize the amount of taxes you’ll need to pay on your casino winnings. </p>
<p>Here are four tips for avoiding taxes on Bitcoin casino winnings: </p>
<ol>
<li>Report Your Winnings</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step in avoiding taxes on Bitcoin casino winnings is to simply report them. This may seem like an obvious step, but many players avoid reporting their winnings in order to avoid paying taxes. </p>
<p>However, not reporting your earnings is a crime, and if you’re caught, you could face steep penalties - including fines and even imprisonment. So it’s always best to simply report your earnings and pay the associated taxes. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Claim Your Winnings as a Business Expense</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re self-employed, you may be able to claim your casino winnings as a business expense. This can help reduce your taxable income and lower the amount of tax you’ll need to pay. </p>
<p>To do this, you’ll need to file a Schedule C with your tax return. This document will list all of your business expenses, including your casino winnings. </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Have Your Winnings Reinvested in More Bitcoin Gambling</li>
</ol>
<p> ASFSAASDSA</p>
<p>AVOIDING TAXES ON BITCOIN CASINO WINNINGS IS A SNAP!</p> <p>All you need to do is reinvest your earnings back into additional gambling.</p> <p>By doing so, any profits you make from these subsequent bets will be considered capital gains rather than regular income.</p> <p>This means that they’ll be taxed at a much lower rate – typically just 15%.</p> <h2 id="avoiding-taxes-on-bitcoin-casino-winnings">4 Tips For Avoiding Taxes On Bitcoin Casino Winnings</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Report Your Winnings:</strong> The first step in avoiding taxes on Bitcoin casino winnings is simply reporting them.</li> <li><strong>Claim Your Winnings as a Business Expense:</strong> If you’re self-employed, you may be able to claim your casino winnings as a business expense.</li> <li><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Have Your Winnings Reinvested in More Bitcoin Gambling: </strong></li></ol></li></ol></li><img src="/assets/uploads/2018/02/Avoiding_Taxes_on_Bitcoin_Casino_Winnings_-_GamblingSites hi_.jpg" alt="" width="593" height="332"/></p>
<h1 id="Bitcoin-Casino-tax-evasion-on-the-rise"><a href="#Bitcoin-Casino-tax-evasion-on-the-rise" class="headerlink" title="Bitcoin Casino tax evasion on the rise"></a>Bitcoin Casino tax evasion on the rise</h1><p>The recent spike in Bitcoin casino tax evasion is worrying government officials around the world.</p>
<p>Bitcoin casinos allow players to gamble with bitcoins, which are a digital currency that is not regulated by governments. This allows players to dodge taxes on their gambling winnings.</p>
<p>The Canadian government has been particularly hard hit by Bitcoin casino tax evasion. In 2017, the Canadian government estimated that it was losing out on $ Cdn 20 million in taxes each year from Bitcoin casino gambling.</p>
<p>To combat this trend, the Canadian government has announced plans to crack down on Bitcoin casinos. It has proposed new regulations that would require Bitcoin casinos to report all of their players’ transactions to the government.</p>
<p>This proposal has been met with criticism by the online gambling community. Some experts argue that it will be difficult for the Canadian government to enforce these regulations, given that Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and can be conducted from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Other countries, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, have also been affected by Bitcoin casino tax evasion. In 2017, Australian tax officials estimated that they were losing out on $ AUS 93 million per year in taxes from Bitcoin casino gambling. The UK government has announced plans to introduce new regulations targeting Bitcoin casinos later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Should-I-report-my-Bitcoin-Casino-winnings"><a href="#Should-I-report-my-Bitcoin-Casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Should I report my Bitcoin Casino winnings?"></a>Should I report my Bitcoin Casino winnings?</h1><p>When you gamble online, there are a number of taxes that may apply to your winnings. This includes federal income tax, state income tax, and the gambling taxes in some cases. So, should you report your Bitcoin Casino winnings?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on a few factors. First, let’s take a look at which taxes might apply. Federal income tax applies to all forms of gambling income. This means that any profits you make from Bitcoin Casino gambling are considered taxable income. State income tax also applies in most cases. And finally, some states have their own gambling taxes that may also apply.</p>
<p>Now that we know which taxes may apply, we can answer the question of whether or not you should report your Bitcoin Casino winnings. Generally speaking, you should report all of your gambling income on your tax return. This includes profits from Bitcoin Casino gambling as well as any other form of gambling. However, there are a few exceptions.</p>
<p>If you only gamble casually and don’t earn a lot of money from it, you may not need to report your winnings on your tax return. The same is true if most of your gambling takes place in another state and the gambling taxes in that state don’t apply to online casino winnings.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s best to report all of your gambling income on your tax return. This will ensure that you pay the right amount of taxes and avoid any potential penalties or problems with the IRS down the road.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-to-taxpayers-Report-your-Bitcoin-Casino-wins"><a href="#IRS-to-taxpayers-Report-your-Bitcoin-Casino-wins" class="headerlink" title="IRS to taxpayers: Report your Bitcoin Casino wins!"></a>IRS to taxpayers: Report your Bitcoin Casino wins!</h1><p>The IRS has been making headlines as of late, after announcing that taxpayers will now be required to report any and all Bitcoin Casino winnings when filing their annual taxes.</p>
<p>This announcement comes as no surprise, as the IRS has been cracking down on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency users for years now. Back in 2014, the IRS issued a notice stating that virtual currencies should be treated as property for tax purposes. And in 2016, the agency began targeting taxpayers who failed to properly report their virtual currency transactions.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for Bitcoin Casino players?</p>
<p>Simply put, you will now need to report any and all Bitcoin Casino winnings as income on your annual tax return. This includes both jackpots and smaller wins. In order to do so, you will need to track the value of your Bitcoin Casino payouts in US dollars at the time of payout.</p>
<p>For example, if you won $1,000 worth of Bitcoin from your favourite casino in 2017, you would need to report that amount as income on your tax return. And don’t forget, you will also need to pay taxes on that income!</p>
<p>Fortunately, most Bitcoin Casino operators will automatically provide information on payouts made in 2017 (and previous years). So there’s no need to worry about tracking everything down manually. Just make sure you check with your casino first to see what information they will be providing.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how this news might impact the overall Bitcoin Casino industry, don’t worry - it’s not all bad news! In fact, many experts believe that this new ruling could actually help legitimize BitcoinCasinos and lead to increased regulation and compliance measures. This could pave the way for even more players to jump on board, ultimately leading to even bigger and better things for the industry as a whole!</p>
