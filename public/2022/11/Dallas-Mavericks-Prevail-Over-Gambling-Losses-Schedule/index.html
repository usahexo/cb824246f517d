The Dallas players stepped up their game and prevailed over the Toronto Raptors in a 116-109 victory. This was their first game after a two-game gambling loss streak.</p>
<p>The Mavericks were led by Luka Doncic who scored 36 points with 12 rebounds and 10 assists for his sixth triple-double of the season. Harrison Barnes added 21 points, nine rebounds, and five assists, while Wesley Matthews came off the bench to score 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting, including 4-of-7 from 3-point range.</p>
<p>According to Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle, the players responded well after an embarrassing home loss to Sacramento that put them at .500. “I thought our guys played hard,” Carlisle said. “I loved our fight.”</p>
<p>The Raptors were led by Pascal Siakam who had 31 points and 11 rebounds while Kyle Lowry added 23 points and eight assists. Kawhi Leonard scored just 18 points on 7-of-20 shooting as he battled foul trouble. Fred VanVleet led Toronto’s reserves with 15 points.</p>
<p>VanVleet called Dallas’ comeback win “a tough one to swallow.” Lowry credited Dallas for playing harder than Toronto did. “They played harder than us tonight,” Lowry said. “They deserved to win.”</p>
<p>The Mavericks will next face the Miami Heat on Thursday night in Florida</p>
<h1 id="Dallas-Mavericks-Remain-Committed-To-Excellence-In-spite-of-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Dallas-Mavericks-Remain-Committed-To-Excellence-In-spite-of-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Dallas Mavericks Remain Committed To Excellence In spite of Gambling Losses"></a>Dallas Mavericks Remain Committed To Excellence In spite of Gambling Losses</h1><p>The Dallas Mavericks have been a great organization for over two decades. They have always been about winning and have always been a class organization. This was evident even in their recent gambling losses.</p>
<p>There is no question that the Dallas Mavericks took a big hit when they lost to the Toronto Raptors in the 2018-2019 playoffs. This was especially true given that the Mavericks entered the playoffs as the number one seed in their conference.</p>
<p>Many people were quick to write off the Mavericks following this loss. However, it is important to note that the Mavericks are still a very good team. They finished the regular season with a record of 52-30. This was good enough for fifth place in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>The Dallas Mavericks also have some very talented players on their roster. Luka Doncic is one of the most promising young players in the NBA. Dirk Nowitzki continues to be one of the best shooters in league history. And Kristaps Porzingis has shown flashes of being one of the best players in the NBA.</p>
<p>The Dallas Mavericks should not be counted out just yet. They still have a very good chance of making it to the NBA Finals this year.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Dallas-Mavericks-Aren’t-The-Only-Team-With-Gambling-Losses-Problem"><a href="#NBA-Dallas-Mavericks-Aren’t-The-Only-Team-With-Gambling-Losses-Problem" class="headerlink" title="NBA: Dallas Mavericks Aren’t The Only Team With Gambling Losses Problem"></a>NBA: Dallas Mavericks Aren’t The Only Team With Gambling Losses Problem</h1><p>The NBA is facing another gambling-related issue.</p>
<p>This time, the focus is on the Dallas Mavericks. As it was previously reported, the Mavericks lost $600,000 as a result of “accidental” wagers placed by team employees.</p>
<p>The league has since launched an investigation into the matter. Commissioner Adam Silver commented on the situation, stating that he was “disappointed” in the Mavericks and that the gambling losses were “not only a legal issue but a moral issue.”</p>
<p>While Silver’s comments are certainly warranted, it’s important to note that the Mavericks are not the only team with a gambling-related issue. In fact, several teams have had similar problems in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Golden State Warriors were fined $500,000 after assistant coach Mike Brown placed unauthorized wagers on games. That same year, the Atlanta Hawks were fined $200,000 after two team employees placed illegal bets on college basketball games.</p>
<p>And in 2018, three members of the Houston Rockets were banned from casino gaming for one year after being caught placing bets on NBA games.</p>
<p>So what’s behind all of these gambling-related issues? And more importantly, what can be done to prevent them from happening again?</p>
<p>There are several possible explanations for why teams are having such trouble staying away from casinos and sportsbooks. For one thing, gambling can be extremely addictive and difficult to resist. And for many athletes and coaches, there’s a lot of temptation to place bets on sporting events. After all, there’s a lot of money at stake and it can be easy to get caught up in the excitement of betting on your favorite team.</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that many teams travel frequently and often have down time during road trips. This can provide opportunities for employees to place illegal bets without getting caught. And with so much money at stake, it’s no wonder that some people are willing to take risks in order to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>So what can be done to address this problem? One possibility is increasing education and awareness about the dangers of gambling addiction. Coaches and athletes need to be educated about the risks associated with gambling and how best to avoid them. This type of education is important not just for professional athletes but also for college athletes who may be more likely to engage in gambling activities.</p>
<p>Another solution is stricter regulation of casino gaming and sports betting. This could involve implementing more stringent rules and regulations governing how teams can interact with casinos and sportsbooks. It could also involve increased fines and penalties for teams that violate these rules.</p>
<p> Finally, league officials could consider restricting or prohibiting team employees from entering casinos altogether. While this may not be ideal for everyone involved, it could help reduce the number of gambling-related issues popping up in the NBA .</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Losses-Schedule-Does-Not-Derail-Dallas-Mavericks’-Season"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-Schedule-Does-Not-Derail-Dallas-Mavericks’-Season" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses Schedule Does Not Derail Dallas Mavericks’ Season"></a>Gambling Losses Schedule Does Not Derail Dallas Mavericks’ Season</h1><p>The Dallas Mavericks are currently in 4th place in the Western Conference of the NBA and look to make a deep playoff run this year. Despite their success on the court, things haven’t been so rosy off of it due to revelations that team owner Mark Cuban suffered massive gambling losses in April.</p>
<p>At first blush, one might think that a gambling loss of such a magnitude would derail the entire season for the Mavericks. To Cuban’s credit, however, he has remained focused on the task at hand and his team has not let the story distract them from playing basketball.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Cuban has had to deal with adversity. He purchased the Mavericks in 2000 when they were a struggling team and has turned them into a perennial playoff contender. It is this track record of success that has enabled him to overcome this latest setback.</p>
<p>While it is still too early to tell how this story will play out, it appears that Cuban and the Mavericks will be able to put it behind them and focus on winning an NBA championship.</p>
<h1 id="Mavericks-Start-New-Chapter-After-Gambling-Losses-Schedule"><a href="#Mavericks-Start-New-Chapter-After-Gambling-Losses-Schedule" class="headerlink" title="Mavericks Start New Chapter After Gambling Losses Schedule"></a>Mavericks Start New Chapter After Gambling Losses Schedule</h1><p>Some teams never recover after gambling losses. The Mavericks are proving that a new chapter can be started.</p>
<p>The Mavericks begin their new schedule with a 106-96 victory over the Orlando Magic. Dallas was behind by five points at halftime but outscored the Magic by 30 in the second half to get the win. Harrison Barnes led the way with 27 points and 11 rebounds.</p>
<p>It was an emotional night for Wesley Matthews, who made his return to Portland for the first time since he signed with Dallas in the offseason. Matthews had 20 points, five rebounds, and four assists in 37 minutes against his former team. “It was a hostile environment,” Matthews said. “I got a lot of texts from a lot of people I know in Portland, saying they were coming to the game and they were going to give me hell.”</p>
<p>The Mavericks will look to continue their winning ways when they host the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night.</p>
