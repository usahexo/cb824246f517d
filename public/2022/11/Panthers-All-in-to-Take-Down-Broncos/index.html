        <h1 id="Panthers-All-in-to-Take-Down-Broncos"><a href="#Panthers-All-in-to-Take-Down-Broncos" class="headerlink" title="Panthers All in to Take Down Broncos"></a>Panthers All in to Take Down Broncos</h1><p>Sunday’s Super Bowl 50 is a matchup of the Broncos and Panthers, but the game has much more at stake. It’s not just a matter of who will take home the Lombardi Trophy; for the Panthers, it’s about taking down Peyton Manning and securing their legacy as one of the greatest teams in NFL history.</p>
<p>For Manning, this is likely his last chance at a Super Bowl ring. At 39 years old, Manning knows that time is running out, and he’s made it clear that he wants to go out on top. A victory over the Panthers would certainly do that.</p>
<p>The Panthers come into this game as heavy favorites. They have been one of the most dominant teams in the NFL this season, finishing with a 15-1 record. The Broncos had a more difficult road to the Super Bowl, edging out the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.</p>
<p>Given Manning’s age and declining skills, many people are picking the Panthers to win easily. But don’t count out Manning just yet; he’s proved time and again that he’s capable of pulling off an upset when everyone expects him to lose.</p>
<p>This should be an exciting game to watch. The Broncos are a team that never gives up, while the Panthers are coming into this game with a vengeance after losing to Seattle in last year’s Super Bowl. It should be a close matchup, with either team potentially able to come out on top.</p>
<p>No matter who wins, one thing is for sure: This year’s Super Bowl is going to be one for the ages.</p>
<h1 id="Carolina-Looks-to-Ride-Momentum-Against-Denver"><a href="#Carolina-Looks-to-Ride-Momentum-Against-Denver" class="headerlink" title="Carolina Looks to Ride Momentum Against Denver"></a>Carolina Looks to Ride Momentum Against Denver</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers come into their Week 6 matchup against the Denver Broncos off of an impressive win against the New England Patriots. Although the Broncos have been one of the most consistent teams in the NFL this season, Carolina will look to use their momentum to pull off the upset victory.</p>
<p>In order to do so, they will need to continue to play strong defensively. The Panthers held Tom Brady and the Patriots offense in check for most of the game, and they will need to do the same against Peyton Manning and the Broncos. Offensively, Cam Newton needs to continue his strong play. He has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL this season and has shown that he can compete with the best of them.</p>
<p>If Carolina can continue to play well on both sides of the ball, they have a good chance of coming away with a win on Sunday. They will need to be prepared for a tough fight, however, as the Broncos are not a team that is easily beaten.</p>
<h1 id="Panthers-Hope-for-Another-Big-Win-in-Denver"><a href="#Panthers-Hope-for-Another-Big-Win-in-Denver" class="headerlink" title="Panthers Hope for Another Big Win in Denver"></a>Panthers Hope for Another Big Win in Denver</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers are coming off a huge home win against the New England Patriots. They will now look to continue their winning ways on the road against the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>The Panthers have had some success in Denver in the past. In fact, they have won two of their last three games against the Broncos, including a 21-20 victory back in 2013.</p>
<p>The Broncos have had an up-and-down season so far. They come into this matchup with a 5-6 record, including a 3-3 mark at home.</p>
<p>Panthers quarterback Cam Newton is coming off a big game against the Patriots. He threw for 316 yards and three touchdowns in that victory. He will look to build on that performance this week against Denver.</p>
<p>Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian has been inconsistent this season. He has thrown for 2,285 yards and 13 touchdowns, but he has also been intercepted 10 times.</p>
<p>The Panthers will look to control the ball on offense with their running game. Led by Jonathan Stewart and Christian McCaffrey, Carolina averaged 131 rushing yards per game in their last three contests.</p>
<p>The Broncos have been inconsistent on defense this season. They allow an average of 318 yards per game, which ranks 27th in the NFL.</p>
<h1 id="Panthers’-Odds-of-Beating-Broncos-Slimmer-Than-Ever"><a href="#Panthers’-Odds-of-Beating-Broncos-Slimmer-Than-Ever" class="headerlink" title="Panthers’ Odds of Beating Broncos Slimmer Than Ever"></a>Panthers’ Odds of Beating Broncos Slimmer Than Ever</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers were absolutely decimated by the Denver Broncos in their last meeting, and the odds of them winning this time around are looking much slimmer.</p>
<p>The Broncos routed the Panthers in Week 1 of last season, with Peyton Manning throwing for over 400 yards and four touchdowns. The Broncos defense was just as imposing, sacking Cam Newton seven times and holding Carolina to just 194 yards of offense.</p>
<p>To make things worse for Newton and the Panthers, Luke Kuechly is expected to miss Sunday’s game due to a concussion. Kuechly is one of the most important players on Carolina’s defense and his absence will be sorely felt.</p>
<p>Even if Kuechly does play, it’s hard to see the Panthers significantly improving on their performance from last year. The Broncos are a much better team this season than they were last year and they will be motivated to make a statement against Carolina after losing in Super Bowl 50.</p>
<p>Given all of these factors, the Panthers are likely to lose again when they face off against the Broncos on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="Can-Cam-Newton-and-the-Panthers-Carry-Their-Winning-Ways-Into-Denver"><a href="#Can-Cam-Newton-and-the-Panthers-Carry-Their-Winning-Ways-Into-Denver" class="headerlink" title="Can Cam Newton and the Panthers Carry Their Winning Ways Into Denver?"></a>Can Cam Newton and the Panthers Carry Their Winning Ways Into Denver?</h1><p>The Carolina Panthers enter Denver with a 6-2 record, fresh off of a 38-10 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. Cam Newton and company will have to be at their best, as they take on the 7-1 Broncos.</p>
<p>This matchup pits the league’s top scoring offense (Carolina, 32.9 PPG) against the top scoring defense (Denver, 16.3 PPG). The Panthers will need to establish their running game early on, in order to keep Peyton Manning and the Broncos’ high-powered offense off of the field.</p>
<p>Cam Newton has been playing exceptionally well this season, posting an NFL-high 103.2 passer rating. He has also rushed for 359 yards and four touchdowns. If the Panthers are able to get Newton into a rhythm early on, they could very well come away with a win in Denver.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be easy, though. The Broncos have one of the best defenses in the NFL, led by linebacker Von Miller and cornerback Chris Harris Jr. They will be looking to slow down Cam Newton and keep him from making big plays with his legs.</p>
<p>If the Panthers can find a way to win on the road against one of the best teams in the NFL, it will only further solidify their status as one of the top teams in football.</p>
