<p>The game, which reportedly took place in a casino in the city of Seville, was watched by a small group of fans and club officials.</p>
<p>Betis took an early lead through some impressive play from striker Loren Moron, and never looked back, cruising to a 4-0 victory.</p>
<p>This result moves them up to third in the table, just one point behind leaders Barcelona.</p>
<p>“We’re really happy with the win,” said Betis midfielder Fabian Ruiz after the game. “It was a tough match but we played well and got the job done.”</p>
<p>Manager Quique Setien was also pleased with the team’s performance. “I’m very happy with the result,” he said. “We controlled the match and played some good football.”</p>
<p>With Barcelona faltering in recent weeks, Betis are now looking like serious contenders for the La Liga title. They will be hoping to continued their winning form when they take on Getafe next weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-card-game-sees-Betis-maintain-their-lead-at-the-top-of-the-table"><a href="#Casino-card-game-sees-Betis-maintain-their-lead-at-the-top-of-the-table" class="headerlink" title="Casino card game sees Betis maintain their lead at the top of the table"></a>Casino card game sees Betis maintain their lead at the top of the table</h1><p>The Betis casino card game saw the team maintain their lead at the top of the table this week, as they comfortably beat relegation strugglers Almeria 3-0. Goals from Antonio Sanabria and Giovani Lo Celso in each half secured all three points for the home side and moved them up to second in the table, just behind Barcelona.</p>
<p>Sanabria’s opener came in lucky circumstances, as his deflected free-kick somehow found its way past diving goalkeeper Diego Marino. The visitors had chances to get back into the game but failed to take them, with Lo Celso doubling Betis’ advantage on the hour mark with a fine solo goal. The midfielder picked up the ball just outside his own penalty area before running half the length of the pitch and beating Marino with a powerful shot.</p>
<p>Former Barcelona player Alex Alegria completed the scoring in stoppage time, firing home from close range after a neat interchange with fellow substitute Sergio Leon. With this win Betis move two points clear of Atletico Madrid and Sevilla, who both suffered defeats over the weekend.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Real Madrid continued their indifferent form by losing 2-1 at home to Valencia. Los Blancos went ahead early on through Casemiro’s header but were soon pegged back by Geoffrey Kondogbia’s stunning long-range strike. Rodrigo then snatched all three points for Valencia late on, rounding Thibaut Courtois and slotting home after being played through by Santi Mina.</p>
<p>The result sees Real Madrid fall six points behind league leaders Barcelona, though they have a game in hand. Elsewhere in the bottom half of La Liga, Deportivo La Coruna pulled off a shock 3-2 win away at Eibar thanks to goals from Lucas Perez, Emre Colak and Florin Andone. Garcia Pintado’s late consolation for Eibar was not enough to prevent them from slipping into the relegation zone.</p>
<h1 id="Real-Betis-take-another-step-towards-the-title-with-casino-card-game-victory"><a href="#Real-Betis-take-another-step-towards-the-title-with-casino-card-game-victory" class="headerlink" title="Real Betis take another step towards the title with casino card game victory"></a>Real Betis take another step towards the title with casino card game victory</h1><p>Real Betis took another step towards the title with a 3-2 victory over UD Las Palmas in a casino card game that was played last night at the Estadio Benito Vilamarín. The victory means that Betis now have an unassailable lead of six points at the top of the table, with just four games left to play.</p>
<p>The home side got off to a flying start, taking the lead in the sixth minute through winger José Joaquín Fernández “Joe”. However, Las Palmas hit back soon afterwards through striker Jonathan Viera, before centre-back Raúl Albentosa restored Betis’ lead just before halftime.</p>
<p>The second half was a much scrappier affair, with both teams having chances to score but it was Betis who ultimately wrapped up the victory thanks to substitute Ángel netting their third goal in stoppage time.</p>
<p>Betis manager Gus Poyet was delighted with his team’s performance and praised them for their “character and fight”, as they continue their pursuit of a first La Liga title since 2005. “We’re on the right track and we’re going to fight until the end”, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Las Palmas boss Quique Setién acknowledged that his side were second best on the night and paid tribute to Betis for being “the better team”. He also warned his players against complacency in their remaining games as they look to secure their place in next season’s edition of La Liga.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-card-game-proves-to-be-a-key-victory-for-Real-Betis"><a href="#Casino-card-game-proves-to-be-a-key-victory-for-Real-Betis" class="headerlink" title="Casino card game proves to be a key victory for Real Betis"></a>Casino card game proves to be a key victory for Real Betis</h1><p>The home side, Real Betis, sealed a well-needed 3-0 victory over Levante UD at the Benito Villamarín Stadium. The game was a key one for Betis, as they looked to get back to winning ways in La Liga after suffering two consecutive defeats.</p>
<p>It was an evenly contested affair in the early stages of the game, with both sides having chances to take the lead. However, it was Betis who eventually broke the deadlock in the 38th minute when Giovani Lo Celso finished off a delightful team move.</p>
<p>The hosts continued to dominate proceedings after the break and doubled their lead through Andrés Guardado in the 63rd minute. The Mexican international midfielder fired home from close range after some good work from Loren Morón down the left flank.</p>
<p>Betis then made sure of all three points with a third goal in the closing stages of the game, courtesy of Sergio Canales. The Spaniard neatly finished off another fine team move to seal an important win for his side.</p>
<p> speaking after the game manager Quique Setién said “We needed this victory; it’s very important for us. We played well and deserved to win”. He also reserved special praise for Giovani Lo Celso, stating that he is “a player with a lot of potential”.</p>
<p>The win moves Betis up to 11th place in La Liga, just two points behind 7th placed SD Eibar. They will now be looking to build on this result as they continue their fight for Europa League qualification.</p>

<p>Ezekiel opened his account for the season midway through the first half, beating the goalkeeper with an excellent strike from distance. Before the break, Sergio Leon made it 3-0 to put Betis in control of the contest.</p>
<p>Levante pulled one back shortly after the interval through Roger Butragueño, but any hopes of a comeback were ended when substitute Loren grabbed Betis’ fourth late on.</p>
<p>The result sees them open up a four-point lead at the summit, with second-placed Espanyolmatching their result on Sunday.</p>
