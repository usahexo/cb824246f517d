#  New Study Shows That Going Lengthy On Sports Betting Sites Is The Key To Winning

A recent study has shown that by spending extended periods of time on sports betting websites, punters are more likely to win money.

The research, carried out by scientists at the University of Portsmouth, found that those who spend more than an hour on such sites each day were 2.5 times more likely to make a profit than those who visit for less than half an hour.

The team analysed data from over 6,000 online gamblers, and found that while overall losses were incurred by all participants, those who gambled longer were more likely to make a net profit.

This is thought to be due to the fact that those who stay longer have time to carry out detailed research on upcoming fixtures, as well as monitoring trends and betting strategies. As a result, they are better placed to identify value bets and make successful wagers.

Dr Colin Woodman, one of the authors of the study, said: "Our research shows that those who spend more time on sports betting websites are more likely to make a profit.

"This is likely because they have time to carry out detailed research on upcoming fixtures, as well as monitoring trends and betting strategies. By doing this, they are able to identify value bets and make successful wagers."

While the findings may not be surprising to experienced gamblers, they provide valuable insight into how best to approach sports betting in order to maximise profits.

#  Should You Ever Go Lengthy In Sports Betting Sites? 

There is no clear-cut answer to this question. On one hand, it can be said that you should never go lengthy in sports betting sites because there is always the risk of losing money.
