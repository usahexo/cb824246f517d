#  Major casinos tighten surveillance of Roulette wheel after insider cheating revealed

Las Vegas - In a bombshell revelation, it has been exposed that major casinos have increased their surveillance of roulette wheels after several high-profile cases of insider cheating.

The scam, which was brought to light by an investigative report by Fox News, involves casino employees who exploit tiny imperfections in the roulette wheel to predict where the ball will land. By betting on specific numbers (or groups of numbers), these employees are able to win consistently and rake in significant profits.

One recent example involved an employee at the Venetian Resort Casino who managed to win more than $1 million in just a few weeks.

Officials at the Venetian say they have since increased their surveillance of roulette wheels and are now monitoring them 24 hours a day. They have also promised to review their security protocols to ensure that such scams are not repeated in the future.

Other casinos are likely taking similar measures, as insiders have reportedly been using this technique at other resorts around Las Vegas for years.

#  How closely do casinos watch Roulette players under time pressure?

Casinos have long been known to use various methods to keep track of their players, but just how closely do they watch Roulette players under time pressure?

One study, conducted by two professors at the University of Alberta in Canada, attempted to answer that question. The study used a combination of player tracking data and mathematical simulations to model the behavior of casino players.

The results showed that casinos do in fact pay close attention to how quickly players make decisions, and they often adjust their betting strategies accordingly. For instance, casinos will often reduce the payout for bets that are placed quickly, while increasing the payout for bets that are placed more slowly.

This is done in an effort to encourage players to take more time in making their decisions, which allows the casinos more opportunity to track their behavior and betting patterns. So if you’re looking to make some quick money at the Roulette table, you may want to think again!

#  Luckiest and unluckiest times to gamble on Roulette in Vegas

The best time to gamble on Roulette in Vegas is when the casino offers a favourable return on your bet. But what are the best and worst times to play?

Some believe that roulette is all about luck and that there’s no way to predict when the ball will land on a particular number. However, by understanding the odds and taking advantage of them, you can tilt the odds in your favour – or at least minimise your losses.

The table below shows the house edge (the percentage of each bet that the casino keeps) for every possible bet on a European roulette wheel. As you can see, some bets have a higher house edge than others:

Bet House Edge Straight up 35:1 Split 17:1 Street 11:1 Corner 8:1 Six line 5:1 Dozen 2:1 Column 1:3 Red or black 1:2 Odd or even 1:1 1-18 or 19-36 1:1

One of the simplest ways to reduce the house edge is to bet on multiple outcomes. For example, if you bet on black and red, your chances of winning are increased from 50 per cent to almost 66 per cent. This is because you’re betting on two different outcomes, and the odds of one cancelling out the other are relatively high.

If you want to make things even easier, consider using an even money bet such as red or black, odd or even, or 1-18/19-36. These bets have a house edge of just 2 per cent, making them much more favourable than straight up bets (which have a house edge of 35 per cent).

Of course, you can also increase your chances of winning by avoiding any bets with a high house edge altogether. So if you’re not feeling lucky, it might be best to wait until another day!

#  New technology used to monitor Roulette gameplay in high-stakes casinos

A new piece of technology that is being used in some high-stakes casinos is a system that can monitor the gameplay of roulette players. This system is able to track not only the bets that are being placed, but also the speed at which those bets are being placed.

This new technology has been met with mixed reactions from players. Some people feel that it is an invasion of their privacy, while others feel that it is a necessary step in order to ensure fair play. The casino industry has long been plagued by accusations of cheating, and this technology is seen as a way to combat that.

One of the benefits of this technology is that it can help to identify patterns in player behavior. This can be helpful in detecting cheating or collusion between players. It can also help casinos to identify which games are being exploited by players and make adjustments accordingly.

Overall, this technology seems to be a positive development for the casino industry. It will help to ensure fair play and discourage cheating. It may also help casinos to identify which games are most popular with players and make changes based on that information.

#  Is your gambling strategy being monitored by casino staff?

A recent study by the University of Alberta has shown that casino staff are able to identify high-rolling gamblers and subsequently put them under surveillance. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the university’s Gambling Research Laboratory, found that casino staff make use of a number of behavioural cues in order to identify players who are likely to lose more money than they intended.

The study was conducted by observing the behaviour of 163 players at a casino in Edmonton, Canada. Casino staff were found to be using techniques such as paying close attention to how much money a player is betting and watching for signs of discomfort or anxiety. Players who were identified as being high-rollers were then subjected to closer surveillance, with some being followed around the casino by staff.

The study found that high-rollers can lose up to 10 times more money than low-rolling players, with an average loss per hour of $442 for high rollers compared to just $44 for low rollers. It was also found that high-rollers are more likely to experience problem gambling behaviours, such as lying about their losses or hiding their gambling from family and friends.

The findings of the study could have implications for both casinos and players alike. For casinos, it provides evidence that close surveillance of high rollers is an effective way of reducing gambling losses. For players, it serves as a warning that their gambling behaviour may be being monitored by casino staff and that they should take steps to ensure they don’t lose more money than they can afford.
