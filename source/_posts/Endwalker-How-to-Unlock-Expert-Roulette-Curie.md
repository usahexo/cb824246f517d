Roulette Curie is a difficult expert-level walker in Endwalker that can be very rewarding to defeat. She has a variety of attacks, including a sweeping fire attack that can quickly deplete your health if you're not careful.

Your first priority should be to take out her turrets. They're weak and can easily be destroyed with a few shots, but they can also deal a lot of damage if you let them stay alive. Once the turrets are down, focus on Curie. Her attacks are powerful but slow, so you have plenty of time to dodge them.

There are a few things you can do to make the fight easier. First, try using a shield to block her fire attack. Second, use grenades or other explosives to take out her turrets and deal damage to her at the same time. And finally, use cover whenever possible to avoid taking unnecessary damage.

With a little bit of luck and some good tactics, you'll be able to defeat Roulette Curie and unlock her expert-level walker for your own use.
