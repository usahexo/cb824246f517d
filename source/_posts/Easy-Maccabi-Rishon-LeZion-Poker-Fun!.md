#  How to Have Fun with Poker – Easy Maccabi Rishon LeZion Style!

Poker is one of the most popular card games in the world. It can be enjoyed by people of all ages and it is a great game to play with friends. Poker is also a great way to make money, but that is not what we are concerned with today. We are here to learn how to have some good old fashioned fun with poker!

The first step is to find some friends who want to play. Poker can be played with any number of players, but it is best with at least four or five. Once you have your friends together, the next step is to select a game to play. There are many different varieties of poker, but the most popular one is Texas Hold’em.

Texas Hold’em is a game that involves each player getting two cards face down and five cards face up. The players then take turns betting on what they think their hand will be. The best hand wins the pot!

If you are new to poker, it might be a good idea to start off playing some simpler versions of the game, such as draw poker or seven card stud. These games are still a lot of fun, but they are a little easier than Texas Hold’em.

Once you have selected a game, it is time to start playing! Each player should put in an equal amount of money into the pot and then the cards will be dealt. The player with the highest card begins the betting and then each player takes turns either betting or folding their hand.

If you win any hands during the course of the game, you will need to show your cards in order to claim the pot. The first player to lose all their chips automatically loses the game. The winner is the last player left with chips in front of them!

Now that you know how to play poker, it is time for some fun! So grab your friends and head on over to your nearest casino or online poker room for some exciting action!
