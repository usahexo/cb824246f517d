#  What is opposite 1 on a roulette wheel?

There is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on which version of roulette you are playing. Some variants use a 0 as the opposite, while others use a 00. In American roulette, the two numbers are both green, so it can be difficult to tell which is which. In European roulette, where there is only one 0, the opposite would be 36.

#  What is opposite 17 on a roulette wheel?

There is no single answer to this question, as the outcome of a roulette wheel is determined by chance. However, some players believe that the opposite number on a roulette wheel is 18. This is because 18 is the next number in sequence after 17, and it is thought that this could lead to more winning spins.

#  What is the opposite of 17 on a roulette wheel?

The opposite of 17 on a roulette wheel would be 1. This is because 17 is the second highest possible number that can be pulled on a roulette wheel, and 1 is the lowest possible number.

#  What are the odds of hitting 17 on a roulette wheel?

When playing roulette, there are a number of bets that you can make on the table. One such bet is to predict which number the ball will fall into after spinning around the wheel. If you guess correctly, then your chosen number will be marked as a winner and you will receive a payout based on the odds that were offered when you placed your bet.

If you're feeling lucky, then perhaps you might want to place a bet on the number 17. This is because the odds of hitting 17 on a roulette wheel are quite high, at just over 5%. So, if you're thinking about betting on this number, then here are some things that you need to know first.

# The Odds of Hitting 17

As we mentioned earlier, the odds of hitting 17 on a roulette wheel are 5.26%. This means that for every 100 spins of the wheel, your chosen number will come up 5 times. While this may not seem like very good odds, it's actually better than many of the other numbers available on the table.

For example, the odds of hitting 12 on a roulette wheel are just 2.7%, which means that it's considerably less likely to come up than 17. In fact, almost half of all numbers have a lower chance of being hit than 17 does. So, if you're looking for a relatively safe bet, then placing your money on this number may be a smart move.

# What You Can Win

If you do happen to guess correctly and hit 17 on a roulette wheel, then you'll win big! The payout for this bet can be incredibly lucrative, sometimes offering as much as 35-1 returns. So, if you put down $10 on this number and it comes up as the winning result, then you'll walk away with $350 in your pocket!
