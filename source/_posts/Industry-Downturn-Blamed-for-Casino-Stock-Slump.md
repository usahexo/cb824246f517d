#  Industry Downturn Blamed for Casino Stock Slump

In recent years, the casino industry has been on the rise with new casinos being built and established ones expanding their operations. In fact, casino stocks have been among the top-performing stocks in the market. However, this upward trend seems to be reversing now that the industry is experiencing a downturn.

The main reason for this downturn is the legalization of gambling in other states. This has resulted in increased competition for casino operators as people can now gamble closer to home. Additionally, there has been a decline in spending by consumers, especially on high-end items such as gaming tables and slots.

As a result of this downturn, casino stocks have taken a hit with several companies seeing their stock prices decline by more than 20%. This includes companies such as Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts, and Las Vegas Sands. While it is still too early to say for certain, it is possible that this could be the beginning of a long-term trend for the casino industry.

#  Nevada Gaming Revenue Plunges in January

Nevada casinos brought in $936 million in January, down 10.5 percent from the same month last year, according to data released Wednesday by the state’s Gaming Control Board.

Gaming revenue from slot machines fell 12.3 percent, while table games revenue decreased 8.8 percent. Slot machines account for more than two-thirds of total casino gaming revenue in Nevada.

The drop comes as casinos statewide face increased competition from neighboring states and the slowdown of the Chinese economy, which has reduced tourism from that country.

“It continues to be a challenging environment for all gaming markets, Nevada and otherwise,” said Mike Lawton, senior research analyst with the control board.

Despite the decline in overall revenue, bingo and keno revenue increased 2.4 percent in January. That was due to an increase in the number of locations offering those games, Lawton said.

Las Vegas Strip casinos saw their gaming revenue fall 11.9 percent in January, while downtown Las Vegas casinos saw a decline of 9.2 percent. Casinos on the outskirts of Las Vegas experienced a 9.9 percent drop in gaming revenue.

#  Atlantic City Casino Revenue Continue to Fall

Atlantic City casino revenue has been on a downward trend in recent years, and the latest figures from the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show that the trend continued in September.

Revenue from casinos in Atlantic City was down 2.9% in September compared to the same month last year. This was the 10th consecutive month of year-over-year declines.

The total amount wagered at Atlantic City casinos was also down in September. Wagers decreased by 3.7% from September 2017 to September 2018.

Slot machine revenue was down 3.6% in September, while table game revenue was down 4%. Revenue from online gambling was down 5.8%.

Atlantic City casino revenue has been declining for several reasons, including competition from casinos in other states and the increasing popularity of online gambling.

#  Macau Casino Stocks Tumble Amid Slowdown Fears

Shares in casino operators in Macau fell sharply on Monday amid fears that China’s crackdown on corruption could lead to a slowdown in the world’s biggest gambling market.

The Hong Kong-listed shares of MGM China Holdings Ltd and Wynn Macau Ltd both tumbled more than 10 percent, while Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd was down more than 7 percent.

“There is a lot of concern about the outlook for VIP (high roller) play, which has been driving Macau casino growth in recent years,” said Benoi Vanderweide, an equity analyst at Moody’s.

Authorities in Beijing have been cracking down on corruption, which has seen officials banned from lavish spending at casinos. The anti-corruption campaign has already taken its toll on the wider economy, with data last week showing growth in China’s services sector slowed to the weakest pace in 17 months in September.

Macau is home to the world’s largest cluster of casinos and generated more than $38 billion in revenue last year, or around seven times that of Las Vegas. But it is also highly dependent on VIP players, who account for more than two-thirds of total revenues.

#  Japan's gaming regulators warn casinos over stock price slump

The Japan Casino Control Commission (JCCC) has issued a warning to casino operators in the country, following a slump in stock prices caused by concerns over the potential impact of gambling on society.

Officials at the JCCC say that they are monitoring the situation and will take appropriate action if necessary, but insist that there is no evidence to suggest that casino gambling will have a negative impact on social order.

The warning comes as casino operator MGM Resorts International reported a sharp fall in its stock price last week, following the release of its quarterly earnings report. MGM's stock price dropped by more than 10% after the report was released, with investors citing concerns about the company's exposure to the Japanese market.

Shares in other leading casino operators, such as Las Vegas Sands Corp and Wynn Resorts Ltd, have also fallen in recent weeks as speculation over Japan's potential gaming industry grows.

Casino gambling is currently illegal in Japan, but lawmakers are considering a bill that would legalise casinos and allow them to be operated by private companies. The bill is expected to be submitted to parliament later this year, and if it is passed it could see the opening of Japan's first casino resorts within three years.

Public opinion in Japan is divided on the issue of casino gambling, with some people concerned about the social effects it could have, while others point to the potential economic benefits it could bring. Proponents of casino gambling argue that it could help to attract more tourists to Japan and boost the economy.
