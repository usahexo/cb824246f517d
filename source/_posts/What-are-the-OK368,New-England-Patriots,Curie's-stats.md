#  What are the OK368,New England Patriots,Curie's stats?


The OK368 baseball club was founded in 1936 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The team played in the Negro American League until its disbandment in 1960. The club was reactivated in 1993 and currently competes in the independent United League Baseball.

Marie Curie (7 November 1867 â€“ 4 July 1934) was a French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was also the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and the only woman to win two Nobel Prizes.

#  Who is their coach?

Their coach is Joel Quenneville. A former NHL player, he was the head coach of the Blues from 1999-2004, winning the Jack Adams Award as NHL Coach of the Year in 2003. He also coached the Blackhawks from 2008-present, where he led them to three Stanley Cup championships (2010, 2013, and 2015).

#  Who is their quarterback?

The Pittsburgh Steelers are trying to figure out who their quarterback is this off-season. The team has said that they will not re-sign Ben Roethlisberger, so they are in the market for a new quarterback.

There are many different quarterbacks who could be a good fit for the Steelers. Some of the quarterbacks who have been mentioned as potential replacements for Roethlisberger include Nick Foles, Phillip Rivers, and Teddy Bridgewater.

Foles had a great season with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He led the Eagles to the Super Bowl and was named MVP of the game. Rivers has been with the Chargers since 2004 and has been very successful in Los Angeles. Bridgewater is coming back from a major injury but has shown promise in his career so far.

The Steelers will likely consider all of these quarterbacks as potential replacements for Roethlisberger. They will also look at other quarterbacks who may be available in free agency or through trade. Whoever the Steelers choose to be their quarterback, he will have big shoes to fill.

#  What are their colors?

When you think of a rainbow, what colors come to mind? The colors in a rainbow are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. These are the colors that are seen in sunlight when it is refracted through raindrops.

Red is at the top of the rainbow and it is followed by orange, yellow, green and so on. Blue is at the bottom of the rainbow and is followed by indigo and violet.

# Why are they different colors?

The colors in a rainbow are different colors because they are made up of light waves that have different lengths. Red light waves are the longest and violet light waves are the shortest. When sunlight shines through raindrops, these light waves are separated and each color is visible as it travels through the air in a cone-shaped pattern.

#  Who are their rivals?

The Detroit Pistons are the National Basketball Association (NBA) team based in the Detroit suburb of Auburn Hills. The Pistons compete in the Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded in 1941 as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). In 1948, the team moved to Detroit and became the only NBA franchise in Michigan. They are also one of the oldest franchises in the NBA.

The team has won three league championships: in 1989, 1990 and 2004. The Pistons were runners-up in 1955, 1956 and 1957. They reached the NBA Finals again in 2005 but lost to the San Antonio Spurs 4 games to 1.

The Detroit Pistons' biggest rivals are probably their divisional rivals, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Indiana Pacers.
