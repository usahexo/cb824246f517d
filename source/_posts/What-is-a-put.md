#  What is a put?

A put is a options contract that gives the holder the right to sell a specific number of shares of the underlying stock at a fixed price, called the strike price, within a certain time period.

The put buyer profits if the stock price falls below the strike price. The put seller profits if the stock price falls below the strike price and the option is exercised.

A European Put option can only be exercised on the expiration date. An American Put Option can be exercised at any time before expiration.

#  What is the difference between a put and call?

In option trading, a put is the right to sell a security at a certain price (the strike price) by a certain date. A call is the right to buy a security at a certain price (the strike price) by a certain date.

The put and call are both derivatives of the underlying security. A derivative is simply a contract between two parties that derives its value from an underlying security.

#  When should you use a put?

A put is a derivative contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a security at a specified price within a certain time frame. This security could be an individual stock or even an index. The price at which the owner can sell is called the strike price, and the time frame in which this sale can take place is called the expiration date.

There are two main reasons why people might use puts: they can be used as a hedging tool or they can be used to speculate on a security's future movement.

When used as hedging tool, puts can help mitigate risk against sudden price declines in a security. For example, if you're long on a stock and you're worried that it might go down in value soon, you could buy a put as insurance. This would give you the right to sell your stock at the current market price no matter how low it falls. If the stock does indeed decline in value, you can then exercise your put and sell your shares at the higher strike price. Conversely, if the stock goes up in value after you've bought the put, you can simply let the option expire worthless.

Puts can also be used for speculative purposes. For example, suppose you believe that a particular stock is about to take a nosedive but don't want to sell your shares just yet. You could buy a put option on that stock instead, giving you the right to sell at a later date at today's prices. If the stock does fall in value as you expected, you can exercise your option and sell your shares at a profit. However, if the stock rises instead, you'll just let the option expire and lose out on any potential gain.

#  How do you make money with puts?

A put option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell a security at a specific price within a certain period of time.

Put options are often used when investors believe that the price of the underlying security will decline. For example, suppose that you believe that the stock of Company X will fall in price within the next few months. You could purchase a put option on Company X's stock, giving you the right to sell it at a specific price by a certain date.

If the stock falls below the specified price by the expiration date of the option, you can choose to sell it at that price. If not, your option expires worthless and you lose the money you paid for it.

# What are the risks of using puts?

When you buy a put option, you have the right, but not the obligation, to sell 100 shares of the underlying security at the strike price any time before the expiration date.

The main risks associated with puts are:

1) The stock may not fall below the strike price. In this case, you would not be able to sell your shares at the desired price.

2) You may not be able to find someone willing to buy your shares at the desired price. If the stock falls below the strike price and there are no buyers available at that level, you may have to sell your shares at a lower price.

3) The value of the put option may decline significantly if the stock does not fal
